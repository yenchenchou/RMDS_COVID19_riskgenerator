2. third party POI area data store in SafeGraph, 
3. COVID-19 cases from [lacounty.gov](http://dashboard.publichealth.lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard)
4. People density from team USC

## How to use this script
1. Clone the whole repository from GitHub

2. Pre-Download data:
A total of 7 files need to download (Don't worry, we have example data for you soon!). Store all the data into `/data/external/` folder

* Data from SafeGraph.com: Need to apply an account
* **Consecutive 3 weeks of user patterns**: Weekly Places Patterns (1-3)
![Weekly Places Patterns](data/internal/image/weekly.png)
* **POI (Point of Interest) data**: Core Places (US Only) (4)
![poi](data/internal/image/poi.png) 
* Third party precalculated data saved in SafeGraph.com:
* **POI area square foot data**: Need to download from AWS CLI (stored in S3) (5)
```aws s3 cp s3://sg-c19-response/geo-supplement/May2020Release/SafeGraphPlacesGeoSupplementSquareFeet.csv.gz <your_local_path> --profile safegraphws --endpoint https://s3.wasabisys.com```
* **infection cases and death cases** from [lacounty.gov](http://dashboard.publichealth.lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/)
* Click `[Table: Community Case/Death]`, then click download (6)
* Click `[Table: Community Testing]`, then click download (7)

3. Check necessary dependencies in `requirements.txt` 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the script:
Go to the folder where you clone the files:
1. Get processed data (for example), you need to enter three weeks of patterns with four digits each:

```Python
python src/python/export_data.py 0722 0729 0805
```

    * You will get the following data:
        1. RMDS_open_hours.csv 
        2. RMDS_poi_area_square_feet.csv
        3. RMDS_poi.csv
        4. RMDS_zipcode_mapper.json
        5. pattern-<date>.csv
        
2. Get the risk score: Open R and edit the correct weekly pattern
    ![R_script](data/internal/image/R_script_shot.png)
    * You will get POI risk score and community risk score in `data/result` folder
        1. risk_poi-YYYY-MM-DD.csv
        2. risk_community-YYYY-MM-DD.csv
